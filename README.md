# Glove for deaf people
(Glove for deaf people) based on the AVR atmega32A microcontroller

# The main components are:

The flexible sensor has a potentiometer that changes with the change in the bending angle which results in a difference in output voltage with the sensors.

With the ADC peripheral in the microcontroller, we can get the analog value on the ADC pins and put some conditions on each ASL tag, then display the corresponding word on the LCD screen or on the mobile phone using the UART communication protocol with the HC-05 bluetooth module.
